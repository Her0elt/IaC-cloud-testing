### Infrastructure as a service
This is basically using the cloud to setup a computer.
You're borrowing a machine from the cloud service provider,
to use as your own computer. With IAS you'll need to manually scale, if needed.
IAS is the same as the olden times, time share consept

### Platform as a service
Is IAS, but with a bit of magic. PAS lets you write code and host it,
but the cloud service provider can handle the automatic scaling of your machine,
depending on load, or other varibles.

### Software as a service
Is stuff like google docs and sheets. Where a cloud service provider provides
different softwares that you can use for a number of different tasks

### Google cloud
On Google cloud you have Google cloud provider (GCP) and G Suit.
GCP is the IAS and PAS side of the google cloud platform and G Suit is the
SAS part of the platform
